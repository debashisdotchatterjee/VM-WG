The one-parameter Wrapped Garima (WG) distribution, while possessing tractable trigonometric moments, suffers from a lack of invariance to generic changes in the circular reference frame. This limitation can introduce bias in statistical inference when the reference system is arbitrary. To address this, we introduce a flexible, four-parameter extension called the von-Mises tilted, location-orientation Wrapped Garima (VM-WG) family. Our new model is constructed by applying a location--orientation transform and an exponential tilt with a von--Mises-like kernel to the original WG density. We prove that the VM--WG family is closed under changes of initial direction and orientation (ICID/ICO), rectifying the original model's primary shortcoming. The inclusion of a concentration parameter $\kappa$ and a location parameter $\mu$ allows for greater flexibility in modeling circular data, while still nesting the original WG distribution as a special case. We derive the normalizing constant and trigonometric moments using the Jacobi-Anger expansion, and we outline a maximum likelihood inference procedure based on score equations. Finally, we discuss how the VM--WG family can be used for more robust and flexible analysis of circular data, providing a superior alternative to the original WG model.
